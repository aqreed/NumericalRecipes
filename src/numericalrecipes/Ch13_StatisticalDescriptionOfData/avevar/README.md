### Avevar - mean and variance

The Jupyter notebooks compare the algorithm in Julia and Python with the Fortran version. The comparison consists in a simple loop, executing the function a million times. The results show clearly that Julia is faster than Fortran and much faster than Python:

| Languague | Python | Julia | Fortran |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Time | 430 ms | 44 ms | 83 ms |
